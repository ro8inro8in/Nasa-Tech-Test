# React Tech Test. A NASA API search application:
I was given the brief and asked to create a web page application that can search a database and retrieve images using the NASA API. The end point was provided to me as part of the brief to use in my code.

# What should happen!
When a user inputs text into the search area and clicks enter there should be a result relative to the search conditions, e.g if they enter a planet or something that exists within the NASA database they will have access to all the related images, if they input something that has no relevance or miss spell something they will receive an error message.

To-do list:
* I would like to make each image more interactive so you can click on the image so it would expand and go to a view in its own window
